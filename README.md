# 📌 EPG Guide - Electronic Programme Guide App

This project is a **Flutter-based Electronic Programme Guide (EPG)** that provides **TV channel listings** and **programme details** with caching and offline support. It utilizes **Riverpod for state management**, **Hive for local caching**, and **Dio for network requests**.

## 📌 Approach

### 1️⃣ Efficient XML Parsing
The app processes large **EPG XML files in a memory-efficient way** using **Dart’s stream-based XML parsing (`toXmlEvents()`)**, avoiding loading the entire file at once.

- **Channels are fetched once** and stored in local cache.
- **Programmes are streamed on demand** for a selected channel/day.

### 2️⃣ State Management (Riverpod)
State is managed with **Riverpod**, using **`AsyncValue`** to handle UI updates properly:

- `ChannelNotifier` → Manages channel listings.
- `ProgrammeNotifier` → Fetches TV programmes dynamically.

### 3️⃣ Caching Strategy (Hive - Offline Support)
The app follows an **offline-first strategy** with Hive for **local storage**:

- **Channels & Programmes** are stored in a **local database (Hive)**.
- **Each programme entry is timestamped** to track data freshness.

### 4️⃣ Repository Pattern
- `EPGRepository` handles **data fetching logic**, deciding when to pull from **cache vs API**.
- **If offline**, it serves cached data first; when online, it fetches fresh data & updates the cache.
